									<p>client recall was born out of a real need for client information storage software. During my last fews years in hair, I made attempts to use a system better than index cards. I succeeded partially. I searched the app store and, at the time, found nothing. I asked my coworkers and found a few slightly different card systems. I opted to use Notes on the iPhone. It was wildly imperfect, inefficient, and completely boring. When we students were put to the task to develop an app with full CRUD functionality I knew immediately what would be born. </p>

									<p>As a user, you may register an account, and edit your information and profile picture. As it pertains to clients, you may add their name, email and phone number. You may also assign visits to the clients. The visit consists of the date seen, cost, any helpful note like a color formula, a personal service rating and a photo. The clients and visits maintain full CRUD functionality. The app is easily navigatable by four buttons in the left sidebar. A user could quickly look up a client by name under "find," browse a full list of clients under "book" and either add a client or a visit under buttons of the same names. In the user profile in the right sidebar, there is a tally of total clients as well as an average rating. Upon login, the rating is an average of all visits, and in updates to a specific client if you are viewing their page.</p>

									<p>The process was an incredible learning experience. This was my first time fully implementing React with hooks. I created a fake database with JSON Database. All photos are of my own clients (used with their permission), all other data is made up from life.</p>
