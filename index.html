              The following projects are listed in descending order. I've been
              staying busy learning VueJS. Featured here are also my capstone
              projects from my time at Nashville Software School. I've included
              a group project and a couple very beginning projects to show the
              road traveled.

                  I created this matching game using VueJS. This was an
                  assignment meant to get us to practice iteration with v-for,
                  using component data, component methods, CSS class binding,
                  passing props, emitting events and using computed properties.

                  I also made this trivia game with VueJS. This assignment,
                  while highlighting my love of Dune, was practice in iteration
                  with v-for, using component data, conditional rendering with
                  v-if, simple methods, passing props and emiting events, and

                  This spelling test is again, a practice assignment from my Vue
                  course. This was practice with simple model binding with

                  component methods, passing props and emiting events, and using

                  TheList is my back-end capstone from NSS made with C#/.NET
                  with a ReactJS front-end. I created this app with busy
                  households in mind. TheList solves the problem of one person
                  having sole responsibility over groceries. TheList is meant to
                  be interactive so that multiple users can affect one list to
                  make sure everyone is represented.

                  client recall is my front-end capstone project from NSS made
                  with ReactJS. I created this app for hairstylists, to solve
                  the very real problem of client information storage. Most hair
                  stylists I know, have used index cards their entire careers to
                  save and update important data such as hair color formulas.

                <p>
                  Holiday Road: Lion Kings is a vacation itinerary building
                  application. A user can build an itinerary comprised of a
                  National Park, an attraction and an eatery. To begin the
                  process, a user will select a state. That kicks off a series
                  of events. Next the user will select a park. That list is
                  populated via the National Park Services API. From there the
                  user can view a photo and other helpful information in order
                  to choose one and add it to the itinerary. Next they will
                  choose an attraction and an eatery in the same fashion as
                  park. These databases are provided by Nashville Software
                  School. The app also fetches from the openweathermap.org
                  weather API as soon as a park is choosen.

                  This was a group project, and our first full professional
                  sprint. We had daily stand-ups and participated in a
                  retrospective when it was all over. My involvement was largely
                  in the planning and facilitating of the group's processes. I
                  was also responsible for building the eatery section. I used
                  the API to fetch the data and filter the data we needed.

                  Joker was 100% a silly app. This was just some practice using

                  because I can easily rememebr the moments where
                  <em>this</em> was hard. And I can rememeber when I got it.

                  I love a good journal session! This journal began as just a
                  form with hard-coded HTML and had no styling requirements.
                  There were multiple revisions along the way. This was
                  incredibly helpful for my understanding of new concepts, and
                  fun too.

                  Our first group project was Hello World, a travel brochure
                  site. Each member of the group chose a country. By way of HTML
                  we created our site to display relevant people, places, and
                  landmarks of interest. This was hard-coded HTML all the way.
                  <em>Automated World</em> was a revisit of Hello World. Each
                  member of the group refactored their HTML into Javascript. I
                  am just as happy to include this as I am my capstone projects.
                  This was the beginning of some major excitement and discovery.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            Over the last ten years, I took over 9000 appointments as a
            hairdresser/stylist/guru/artist. I worked alongside and with over 40
            other uniquely talented individuals. I excelled in wedding hair,
            detailed and picture-perfect hair color transformations and even
            barbering. I was always learning, trying to challenge myself, and
            pushing to do my best work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Amidst those years, I moved away from my hometown of Champaign,
            Illinois and settled in Denver, Colorado. I met my husband. I
            started a mildly extreme gym experience and after three years,
            sustained a mildly extreme injury. Work was suddenly intollerable
            and a new plan that had been simmering, had to fully cook.
          </p>

          <p>
            I dove in to the idea of web developement. For all I knew about it,
            it was an easy choice. I knew it would be a huge change, but after
            ten years of full-contact socializing/unlicensed therapy/hair art I
            was ready.
